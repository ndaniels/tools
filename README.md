This package provides a litany of command line programs that provide access
to the various libraries that exist in the TuftsBCB organization.

In most cases, command line tools are typically very small and only
representative of an interface to interact with an existing library. In more
exceptional circumstances where performance is needed, a command line tool
may use concurrency in an attempt to decrease execution time.
